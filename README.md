Small markets (flea markets, farmers markets, etc.) can display how many stalls they have available and of what size. They can also list the current merchants and link to the vendor's profile so customers can see their products. Merchants can rent available stalls on the application and have a display for their store. Merchants can upload and update their inventory or services to display on their profile.

A online platform for merchants to rent stalls from markets to sell produce at public farmers markets.



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features

-    Signup as a market user or vendor user
-    As a market user, advertise/display your market stalls to sell (upload image)
-    As vendor user, search for suitable stalls to purchase (orders/carts)
-    Market user, signup with stripe through our platform to receive payment directly from vendors (stripe connect)

- Support JSON

# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here
Firebase authentication

Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

Firebase Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it can be easily integrated with your custom backend.



## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here
Stripe Connect

Marketplaces and platforms use Stripe Connect to accept money and pay out to third parties. Connect provides a complete set of building blocks to support virtually any business model, including on-demand businesses, e‚Äëcommerce, crowdfunding, and travel and events.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Firebase Storage

Firebase storage was used for image upload feature

Cloud Storage for Firebase lets developers upload and share user generated content, such as images, allowing the app to contain colorful media content. The data is stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket, an exabyte scale object storage solution with high availability and global redundancy. Cloud Storage lets users securely upload these files directly from mobile devices and web browsers.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products

## Other Scripts

üö´replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
